# Suicide-Analysis-and-Prediction

The main topic of this work is to predict the next 3 years suicide rates in male gender. We use an ARIMA model

# Objective

DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:

- Suicides in the world in 2015

- Spain suicides per generation 

- Relation between suicides per 100K and the gdppercapita of countries in the 2015

- Suicides in the world in the 2015 group by age

- Time Series of Spain: difference between male and female

- Relation between suicides per 100K and the HDI of countries in the 2015

- CLUSTERING and understanding
